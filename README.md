# TrainControlOneTrack
Control the motor speed and direction, on one track, both sides are controlled by UltraSonic sensors. Two modules: Train Control and US control. 
The motormodule is based on Arduino Nano with motor shield. 
The US module are same exapt for different I2C addr
communication between 3 modules (train and 2 US ) is via I2c
design was on Arduino IDE cloud.
